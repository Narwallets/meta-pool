# GREAT NEWS!!!

## Welcome to the beta-test launch of DIV-POOL, one of the first BIG DAOs on NEAR!

The beta-test period on GUILDNET is starting, and we need a lot of help from the guild and the NEAR community.

### What's the div-pool?

See [here](https://narwallets.github.io/diversifying-staking-pool/)

### What can I do?

#### Testing

* Test the web app, report bugs here [github.com/Narwallets/dapp-diversifying-staking-pool/issues](https://github.com/Narwallets/dapp-diversifying-staking-pool/issues)
* If find a bug in the contract, report it here [github.com/Narwallets/diversifying-staking-pool/issues](https://github.com/Narwallets/diversifying-staking-pool/issues)

#### Designing

* Help by adding beauty to our basic UI 
* More than one UI design, might be popular

#### Analyzing

* Help define Tokenomics for G-SKASH

#### Coding

* Squash bugs with PRs, on any of the repos
* Start designing and or coding the Governance-Contract
* Propose and add new features

### Will contributors be rewarded?

Yes, G-SKASH (The governance token) will be awarded to collaborators. Your G-SKASH will be awarded to your account during div-pool mainnet implementation.

### What will be the value of a G-SKASH on mainnet?

It's not clear now. It depend on the final tokenomics, it depends on the amount of funding the div-pool attracts, and the future G-SKASH demand.
